HW3-------Statistical parsing

0. Make sure you have JDK1.8
    export JAVA_HOME=/home/yufeng/lib/jdk1.8
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

1. Compile.
   Assume you have lib/mallet-deps.jar in current folder;
   Run ./compile.sh;
   ./bin/ contains all the .class files.

2. Parser.

    //Using the entire 00 section as the initial set.
    cat wsj/00/*.mrg > wsj/init.mrg 

    //Using 01 to 03 sections as the training set.
    cat wsj/0[123]/*.mrg > wsj/0103.mrg 

    //Using 20 section as the testing set.
    cat wsj/20/*.mrg > wsj/20.mrg

3. Command line options.

        -trainBank: file for training
        -initBank: file for initial set
        -candidateBank: temporary file for I/O during selection/ordering
        -testBank: file for testing
        -selectionFunction: RAN, LEN, PROB, TREE
        -K: K value for tree entropy. 10 by default.
        -iteration: number of iteration.  20 by default.
        -wordsPerIter: words per iteration. 1500 by default

4. Execute.

    java -mx4500m -cp bin/:lib/stanford-parser.jar:lib/commons-cli-1.2.jar edu.utexas.nlp.ActiveLearner -selectionFunction TREE -initBank wsj/init.mrg -trainBank wsj/0103.mrg -testBank wsj/20.mrg -candidateBank wsj/temp.mrg -K 10

    You can also reproduce the entire results of the report(figure 1 to 5) by executing the following scripts sequentially.

    batch.sh 
    init01.sh  
    train46.sh
    batch2500.sh 
    topk.sh
