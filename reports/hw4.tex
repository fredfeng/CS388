\section{Summary}\label{sec:intro}
Using natural language to write programs is a challenge problem.
Le~\cite{smart} addressed the specific problem of synthesizing smartphone 
automation scripts from natural language. When the user fires a task in 
natural language like this:
\begin{quotation}
``When I receive a new SMS and I am driving, reply the send ``I'm driving."."
\end{quotation}
his system will generate the following executable script:
\small\begin{verbatim}
when (number, content) := MessageReceived()
    if (IsConnectedToBTDevice(Car_BT) then
        SendMessage(number, "I'm driving");
\end{verbatim}
Specifically, Le's approach has two key ingredients: First, design
a domain specific language to bridge the gap between natural language and the
target script; Second, for the data- flow that can not be inferred by 
standard NLP techniques, he uses techniques from the Program Synthesis community
to infer the missing relations.

The paper reduces the task of generating smartphone script to weaving a set of 
related APIs. To achieve this goal, his system first identify a set of components 
through standard NLP techniques like parse tree and bag-of-words as features; 
To infer the relations among components, it adopts the rule-based technique to 
generate the relations and uses program synthesis to infer the missing ones. For
the relation that has multiple candidates, it designs a ranking scheme to pick up
the one with a highest probability.

The paper evaluates the technique through 50 online task descriptions and the result
sounds promising: the precision is over 90\%.


\section{Improvement}\label{sec:alg}
The key insight of active learning is to pick up the sample with the highest 
uncertainty.  
\subsection{Evaluation}
Choose a scientific paper from a conference or journal related to your proposed final project. Read the chosen paper and write a short 2 page type-written report. The first page of the report should briefly summarize the paper. The second page should discuss limitations of this existing work that your final project will address and/or how your own project relates to this existing work by extending or replicating it in some way.
