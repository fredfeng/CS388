what WP
made VBD
the DT
Morton caps NNP

such DT
a DT
hot JJ
one CD
? .
? .

The caps DT
answer NN
is s VBZ
that IN
it PRP
was s VBD
a DT
combination NN
of IN
circumstances s NNS

First caps RB
, ,
the DT
general JJ
stock NN

been VBN
boiling ing VBG
upward RB
for IN
the DT
last JJ
few JJ
months s NNS
, ,
driving ing VBG
stocks s NNS
of IN
all DT
kinds s NNS
up RP

As s caps IN
a DT
result NN
, ,
it PRP
is s VBZ
not RB
easy JJ
to TO
find VB
a DT
stock NN
priced VBN
as s IN
the DT
Morton caps NNP
issue NN
was s VBD
priced VBN
( (
at IN
roughly RB
10 CD
times s CC
1960 CD

, ,
to TO
yield VB
a DT
little JJ
over IN
5 CD
per IN
cent NN
on IN
the DT
64-cent JJ
anticipated JJ
dividend NN
) )
. .

Second caps JJ
, ,
the DT
`` ``
potato NN
chip NN
industry NN
'' ''
has s VBZ
caught VBN
the DT
fancy NN
of IN
investors s NNS
lately RB
, ,
and CC
until IN
Morton caps NNP
Foods s caps NNP
came VBD
along RB
there EX

only RB
two CD

Both caps DT

those DT
have VBP
had VBD
dynamic JJ
run-ups s NNS
in IN

in IN
recent JJ
months s NNS
, ,
both DT
were VBD
selling ing VBG
at IN
higher JJR
price-earnings s NN
and CC
yield NN
bases s NNS
than IN
Morton caps NNP
was s VBD
coming ing VBG

at IN
, ,
and CC
everyone NN
who WP
knew VBD
anything ing NN
about IN
it PRP
expected VBD
the DT
Morton caps NNP

to TO
have VB
a DT
fast JJ
run-up NN
. .

And caps CC
third JJ
, ,
the DT
potato NN
chip NN
industry NN
has s VBZ
taken VBN
on IN
the DT
flavor NN
of IN
a DT
`` ``

in IN

as s IN
I caps PRP

, ,
is s VBZ
that DT
90 CD

I caps PRP
never RB

at IN

both DT

no DT

They caps PRP
either RB

Now caps RB
they PRP
go VBP
to TO

that WDT

two CD

One caps PRP
might MD

They caps PRP
could MD
walk VB

It caps PRP
's s VBZ
much RB
more RBR

Generally caps RB
, ,
they PRP

with IN
a DT

Gloriana caps NNP

who WP
lives s VBZ
down IN

This s caps DT
is s VBZ
a DT
way NN
of IN

, ,
but CC
, ,
I caps PRP
understand VBP

it PRP
entails s VBZ
a DT
certain JJ

of IN
social JJ

A caps DT
young JJ
man NN
does s VBZ
n't RB
like VB

`` ``
Why caps WRB

'' ''
? .
? .

I caps PRP

`` ``
My caps PRP$

through IN

I caps PRP

`` ``

I caps PRP

`` ``
I caps PRP
did VBD
n't RB
happen VB

I caps PRP
explained VBD

however RB

that IN
I caps PRP

my PRP$

in IN
making ing VBG
my PRP$
daily JJ

to TO
the DT
feet NNS

I caps PRP
had VBD
to TO
ride VB
a DT
streetcar NN
two CD

Sometimes s caps RB
the DT
streetcar NN
was s VBD
late JJ

Sometimes s caps RB
there EX
were VBD
n't RB
even RB
any DT

I caps PRP
had VBD
to TO
stand VB
up RP
, ,
with IN
the DT

Sometimes s caps RB
I caps PRP
got VBD
on IN
the DT
wrong JJ
car NN
and CC
did VBD
n't RB
get VB
to TO
school NN
at IN
all DT
, ,
but CC
wound VBD
up IN
at IN
the DT
ocean NN
, ,
or CC
some DT
other JJ
dismal JJ
place NN
, ,
and CC
had VBD
to TO
spend VB
the DT
day NN
there RB
. .

I caps PRP
've VBP
tried VBD
to TO
compromise VB
by IN
letting ing VBG
them PRP
take VB
the DT
little JJ
car NN
now RB
and CC
then RB

When caps WRB
they PRP
do VBP
that DT
my PRP$

to TO
drive VB
me PRP

in IN

She caps PRP
has s VBZ
to TO
have VB
at IN

one CD

I caps PRP
feel VBP
a DT
certain JJ
loss s NN

when WRB
I caps PRP

in IN
a DT

my PRP$
wife NN
, ,
who WP
is s VBZ
only RB
a DT
woman NN

Even caps RB
that DT
is s VBZ
n't RB
satisfactory JJ

If caps IN
they PRP
have VBP
to TO
take VB
any DT

, ,
they PRP
'd MD
rather RB
take VB
the DT
big JJ
one CD

They caps PRP
say VB
that IN
when WRB
they PRP
take VBP
a DT
car NN
, ,
Gloriana caps NNP
does s VBZ
n't RB
take VB
her PRP
car NN
, ,
but CC
rides s VBZ
with IN
them PRP

But caps CC
when WRB
Gloriana caps NNP
rides s VBZ
with IN
them PRP
they PRP
also RB
have VB
to TO
take VB
the DT
two CD
girls s NNS
who WP
usually RB
ride VB
with IN
her PRP
, ,
so CC
the DT
little JJ
car NN
is s VBZ
n't RB
big JJ
enough RB
. .

The caps DT
logic NN
of IN
that DT
is s VBZ
impeccable JJ
, ,
of IN
course NN
, ,
except IN
that IN
I caps PRP
feel VBP
like IN
a DT
fool NN
being ing NN
driven VBN

in IN
a DT

, ,
by IN
my PRP$

when WRB
everybody NN
knows s VBZ
I caps PRP
have VBP
a DT
big JJ

and CC

The caps DT
solution NN
, ,
naturally RB

is s VBZ
the DT

However caps RB
, ,
it PRP
's s VBZ
a DT
half-mile JJ
walk NN
down IN

it PRP

The caps DT

The caps DT

Moreover caps RB

The caps DT
