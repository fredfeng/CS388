Since IN

they PRP

. .

But CC
what WP
made VBD
the DT
Morton NNP
Foods NNP
stock NN
issue VB
such DT
a DT
hot JJ
one CD
? .
? .

The DT
answer NN
is VBZ
that IN
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
combination NN
of IN
circumstances NNS
. .

First RB
, ,
the DT
general JJ
stock NN
market NN
has VBZ
been VBN
boiling VBG
upward RB
for IN
the DT
last JJ
few JJ
months NNS
, ,
driving VBG
stocks NNS
of IN
all DT
kinds NNS
up RP
. .

As IN
a DT
result NN
, ,
it PRP
is VBZ
not RB
easy JJ
to TO
find VB
a DT
stock NN
priced VBN
as IN
the DT
Morton NNP
issue NN
was VBD
priced VBN
( (
at IN
roughly RB
10 CD
times CC
1960 CD
earnings NNS
, ,
to TO
yield VB
a DT
little JJ
over IN
5 CD
per IN
cent NN
on IN
the DT
64-cent JJ
anticipated JJ
dividend NN
) )
. .

Second JJ
, ,
the DT
`` ``
potato NN
chip NN
industry NN
'' ''
has VBZ
caught VBN
the DT
fancy NN
of IN
investors NNS
lately RB
, ,
and CC
until IN
Morton NNP
Foods NNP
came VBD
along RB
there EX
were VBD
only RB
two CD
potato NN
chip NN
stocks NNS
-- :
Frito NNP
and CC
H.W. NNP
Lay NNP
-- :
on IN
the DT
market NN
. .

Both DT
of IN
those DT
have VBP
had VBD
dynamic JJ
run-ups NNS
in IN
price NN
on IN
the DT
market NN
in IN
recent JJ
months NNS
, ,
both DT
were VBD
selling VBG
at IN
higher JJR
price-earnings NN
and CC
yield NN
bases NNS
than IN
Morton NNP
was VBD
coming VBG
to TO
market VB
at IN
, ,
and CC
everyone NN
who WP
knew VBD
anything NN
about IN
it PRP
expected VBD
the DT
Morton NNP
stock NN
to TO
have VB
a DT
fast JJ
run-up NN
. .

And CC
third JJ
, ,
the DT
potato NN
chip NN
industry NN
has VBZ
taken VBN
on IN
the DT
flavor NN
of IN
a DT
`` ``
growth NN
'' ''
industry NN
in IN
the DT
public JJ
mind NN
of IN
late RB
. .

Foods NNS
, ,
which WDT
long RB
had VBD
been VBN
considered VBN
`` ``
recession NN
resistant NN
'' ''
but CC
hardly RB
dynamic JJ
stocks NNS
, ,
have VBP
been VBN
acting VBG
like IN
growth NN
stocks NNS
, ,
going VBG
to TO
higher JJR
price-earnings NNS
ratios NNS
. .

The DT
potato NN
chip NN
industry NN
these DT
days NNS
is VBZ
growing VBG
, ,
not RB
only RB
as IN
a DT
result NN
of IN
population NN
increase NN
and CC
public JJ
acceptance NN
of IN
convenience NN
foods NNS
, ,
but CC
also RB
because IN
of IN
a DT
combination NN
of IN
circumstances NNS
that WDT
has VBZ
led VBN
to TO
growth NN
by IN
merger NN
. .

The DT
history NN
of IN
the DT
U.S. NNP
potato NN
chip NN
industry NN
is VBZ
that IN
many JJ
of IN
today NN
's POS
successful JJ
companies NNS
got VBD
started VBN
during IN
the DT
deep JJ
depression NN
days NNS
. .

Those DT
that WDT
remain VBP
are VBP
those DT
that WDT
were VBD
headed VBN
by IN
strong JJ
executives NNS
, ,
men NNS
with IN
the DT
abilities NNS
to TO
last VB
almost RB
30 CD
years NNS
in IN
the DT
competitive JJ
survival NN
of IN
the DT
fittest JJS
. .

But CC
today NN
many JJ
of IN
those DT
men NNS
are VBP
reaching VBG
retirement NN
age NN
and CC
suddenly RB
realizing VBG
that IN
they PRP
face VBP
an DT
estate NN
tax NN
problem NN
with IN
their PRP$
closely RB
held VBN
companies NNS
and CC
also RB
that IN
they PRP
have VBP
no DT
second-echelon JJ
management NN
in IN
their PRP$
firms NNS
. .

So IN
they PRP
go VBP
looking VBG
for IN
mergers NNS
with IN
other JJ
firms NNS
that WDT
have VBP
publicly RB
quoted VBN
stock NN
, ,
and CC
almost RB
daily RB
they PRP
pound VBP
on IN
the DT
doors NNS
of IN

All PDT
those DT
things NNS

to TO
make VB
the DT
Morton NNP

stock NN
the DT
hot JJ

that IN
it PRP

Now RB

every DT

that IN

it PRP
up IN

I PRP

that DT
90 CD

I PRP
never RB

a DT

I PRP

it PRP
entails VBZ
a DT
certain JJ

A DT

A DT
young JJ
real JJ

the DT
problems NNS

Communism NNP
when WRB
in IN
the DT
Navy NNP

He PRP
was VBD
particularly RB
struck VBN
by IN
a DT
course NN
on IN

Kern NNP
began VBD
reading VBG
a DT

about IN

history NN

but CC
never RB
felt VBD
there EX

anything NN
he PRP
, ,
as IN
an DT
individual NN

could MD
do VB
about IN

When WRB

school NN
here RB
about IN
six CD

Jim NNP
became VBD
convinced VBN

individual NN
can MD
do VB
something NN
constructive JJ
in IN
the DT
ideological JJ
battle NN
and CC
set VBD
out RP
to TO
do VB
it PRP

The DT
best JJS
approach NN
, ,
he PRP
figured VBD

was VBD
to TO
try VB
to TO
influence VB
young JJ
people NNS
like IN
the DT
high JJ

he PRP
and CC
his PRP$
wife NN

that IN

also RB
about IN

the DT
only JJ
antidote NN

Shortly RB

Mr. NNP

Mr. NNP

Developments NNP

the DT
advisability NN

Initially RB
the DT

that IN

In IN

the DT

U.S. NNP
willingness NN

Beyond IN

Ambassador NNP

The DT

The DT

Apparently RB

the DT
simultaneous JJ

`` ``

The DT
outlook NN
The DT
Vienna NNP

bring VB
together RB
a DT
seasoned JJ

67-year-old JJ

President NNP
( (

with IN
a DT

capacity NN

little JJ
experience NN
in IN

The DT
announcement NN
last JJ

of IN
the DT
forthcoming JJ
encounter NN
produced VBD
strong JJ
reactions NNS
in IN
the DT
U.S. NNP
of IN
both DT
approval NN
and CC
disapproval NN
. .

The DT
approval NN
did VBD
not RB
arise VB
from IN
an DT
expectation NN
of IN
far-reaching JJ
agreements NNS
at IN
Vienna NNP
. .

The DT
inclination NN
was VBD
to TO
accept VB
the DT
statement NN
that IN
there EX
would MD
be VB
no RB
formal JJ
negotiations NNS
. .

But CC
those DT
who WP
were VBD
in IN
favor NN
of IN
the DT
meeting NN
felt VBD
that IN
a DT
frank JJ
exchange NN
between IN
the DT
two CD
men NNS
and CC
an DT
opportunity NN
to TO
size VB
one CD
another DT
up RP
would MD
prove VB
salutary JJ

Mr. NNP
Khrushchev NNP
is VBZ
known VBN
to TO
rely VB
heavily RB
on IN
his PRP$
instincts NNS
about IN
his PRP$
adversaries NNS
and CC
to TO
be VB
a DT
shrewd JJ
judge NN
of IN
men NNS

The DT
feeling NN
was VBD
that IN
he PRP
would MD
sense VB
an DT
inner JJ
core NN
of IN
toughness NN

determination NN
in IN
the DT
President NNP
and CC
that DT
plain JJ
talk NN
by IN
Mr. NNP
Kennedy NNP
would MD
give VB
him PRP
pause NN

Apart RB
from IN
the DT
personal JJ
equation NN
, ,
another DT
reason NN
advanced VBN
in IN
favor NN
of IN
the DT
meeting NN
was VBD
that IN
too RB
often RB
in IN
the DT
past NN
the DT
U.S. NNP
appeared VBD
to TO
have VB
been VBN
dragged VBN
reluctantly RB
to TO
the DT
summit NN

Premier NNP
Khrushchev NNP
has VBZ
made VBN
propaganda NN
capital NN
out IN
of IN
that DT
fact NN
and CC
in IN
the DT
end NN
got VBD
his PRP$
summit NN
meeting NN
anyway RB

This DT
time NN
the DT
initiative NN
came VBD
, ,
in IN
part NN
at IN
least JJS
, ,
from IN
Washington NNP

Other JJ
allies NNS
consulted VBN
There EX
was VBD
also RB
the DT
fact NN
that IN
by IN
the DT
time NN
he PRP

Mr. NNP
Khrushchev NNP
, ,
the DT
President NNP
will MD
have VB
completed VBN
conversations NNS
with IN
all DT
the DT
other JJ
principal JJ
Allied JJ
leaders NNS

Thus RB
he PRP
will MD
be VB
in IN
a DT
position NN

disabuse VB
the DT
Soviet JJ
leader NN

any DT
notions NNS
he PRP
may MD
have VB
about IN

Allied JJ
disunity NN

Finally RB
, ,
there EX
was VBD
a DT
wide JJ
area NN
of IN
agreement NN
on IN

value NN

making VBG
a DT
final JJ
effort NN
in IN
the DT
summit NN
spotlight NN
for IN
a DT
nuclear JJ
test NN

There EX
is VBZ
no DT
single JJ
issue NN
that IN
has VBZ
aroused VBN
stronger JJR
feelings NNS
throughout IN
the DT
world NN
. .

If IN
tests NNS
are VBP
to TO
be VB
resumed VBN
, ,
the DT
argument NN
went VBD
, ,
it PRP
is VBZ
vital JJ
that IN
the DT
U.S. NNP
make VB
plain JJ
that IN
the DT
onus NN
belongs VBZ
to TO
the DT
Soviet NNP
Union NNP
. .

Disapproval NN
of IN
the DT
meeting NN
was VBD
based VBN
largely RB
on IN
the DT
belief NN
that IN
the DT
timing NN
could MD
hardly RB
be VB
worse JJR
. .

After IN
Cuba NNP
and CC
Laos NNP
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
argued VBN
, ,
Mr. NNP
Khrushchev NNP
will MD
interpret VB
the DT
President NNP

consent NN
to TO
the DT
meeting NN
as IN
further JJR
evidence NN
of IN
Western JJ
weakness NN
-- :
perhaps RB
even RB
panic NN

and CC
is VBZ
certain JJ
to TO
try VB
to TO
exploit VB
the DT
advantage NN
he PRP
now RB
believes VBZ
he PRP
holds VBZ
. .

Moreover RB
, ,
the DT
President NNP
is VBZ
meeting VBG
the DT
Soviet JJ
leader NN
at IN
a DT
time NN
when WRB
the DT
Administration NN
has VBZ
still RB
not RB
decided VBD
on IN
the DT
scope NN
of IN
America NNP
's POS
firm JJ
foreign JJ
policy NN
commitments NNS
. .

The DT
question NN
was VBD
raised VBN
, ,
for IN
example NN
, ,
as IN
to TO
what WDT
attitude NN
the DT
President NNP
would MD
take VB
if IN
Mr. NNP
Khrushchev NNP
proposes VBZ
a DT
broad JJ
neutral JJ
belt NN
extending VBG
from IN
Southeast NNP

Middle NNP
East NNP

There EX
are VBP
, ,
so RB
my PRP$
biologist NN
friends NNS
tell VBP
me PRP
, ,
mechanisms NNS
of IN
adaptation NN
and CC
defense NN
that WDT
are VBP
just RB
too RB
complete JJ

too RB
satisfactory JJ

Mollusks NNS
are VBP
a DT
case NN
in IN
point NN

The DT
shell NN

which WDT
served VBD
the DT
strain NN
so RB
well RB
at IN
a DT
relatively RB
early JJ
stage NN
in IN
the DT
evolutionary JJ
scheme NN
, ,
tended VBD
to TO
cancel VB
out RP
the DT
possibility NN

development NN

Though IN
this DT
may MD
or CC
may MD
not RB
be VB
good JJ
biology NN

it PRP
does VBZ
aptly RB
illustrate VB
the DT
strength NN

the DT
weakness NN
of IN
American JJ

There EX

be VB
no DT

that IN
the DT
American JJ
Catholic JJ
accomplishment NN

our PRP$

cease VB
to TO
marvel VB
at IN
the DT
number NN
and CC
the DT
size NN
of IN
our PRP$
colleges NNS

The DT
deeper JJR
wonder NN
is VBZ
how WRB
this DT
miracle NN
was VBD
accomplished VBN
in IN
decades NNS
, ,
rather RB
than IN
in IN
centuries NNS
and CC
by IN
immigrant JJ
minorities NNS
at IN
that DT

By IN
way NN
of IN
explanation NN
we PRP
ourselves PRP
are VBP
prone JJ
to TO
imagine VB
that IN
this DT
achievement NN
stems VBZ
from IN
the DT
same JJ
American JJ
Catholic JJ
zeal NN

generosity NN
which WDT
brought VBD
the DT
parochial JJ
school NN

There EX

, ,
however RB
, ,
one CD
curious JJ
discrepancy NN

this DT

flattering JJ
picture NN

Viewing VBG
the DT
American JJ
Catholic JJ
educational JJ
achievement NN
in IN

we PRP
may MD
indeed RB
see VB
it PRP
as IN
a DT
unified VBN
whole NN
extending VBG
from IN

But CC
the DT
simple JJ
truth NN
is VBZ
that DT
higher JJR
education NN
has VBZ
never RB
really RB
been VBN
an DT
official JJ
American JJ
Catholic JJ
project NN
; :

certainly RB
not RB
in IN

sense NN
that IN
the DT
establishment NN
of IN
a DT
parochial JJ

has VBZ
been VBN
a DT
matter NN
of IN
official JJ
policy NN

Official JJ
encouragement NN
is VBZ
one CD
thing NN
, ,
but CC
the DT
down-to-earth JJ
test NN
is VBZ
the DT
allocation NN
of IN
diocesan JJ
and CC
parochial JJ
funds NNS

American JJ
Catholics NNPS
have VBP
responded VBN
generously RB

bishops NNS

pastors NNS

appeals NNS

They PRP

so RB
for IN
the DT
simple JJ
reason NN
that IN
such JJ
appeals NNS

hardly RB
ever RB

Diocesan JJ
authorities NNS
generally RB
have VBP
not RB

All DT

understandable JJ
enough RB

it PRP

however RB

in IN

difficult JJ

how WRB

otherwise RB
. .

Yet CC
for IN
better JJR
or CC
for IN
worse JJR
, ,
the DT
truth NN
of IN
the DT
matter NN
is VBZ
that DT
most JJS
American JJ
Catholic JJ
colleges NNS
do VBP
not RB
owe VB
their PRP$
existence NN
to TO

Catholic JJ
support NN
but CC
rather RB
to TO
the DT
initiative NN

resourcefulness NN

sacrifices NNS
of IN
individual JJ

Community NN
esprit FW

has VBZ

the DT

the DT

something NN
more JJR

the DT

A DT

a DT
degree NN

The DT
fact NN

The DT

a DT
uniquely RB

sense NN
of IN

the DT

which WDT

the DT

American JJ

Let VB

The DT

The DT

in IN

When WRB

they PRP

The DT
Belgians NNPS
also RB
placed VBD
great JJ

During IN
the DT
1950s CD
there EX
were VBD
as RB
many JJ
as IN
25,000 CD
schools NNS
in IN
the DT
Congo NNP

But CC
almost RB
all PDT

The DT

But CC
they PRP

not RB

much RB

It PRP

their PRP$
conviction NN
that IN

Why WRB

In IN

The DT

The DT

would MD
not RB

It PRP

Yet CC
there EX

other JJ

actions NNS
which WDT
the DT
Belgians NNPS
took VBD
after IN

for IN
which WDT
history NN
may MD

them PRP

As IN

there EX

in IN

no RB
fewer RBR

120 CD
political JJ

eight CD

There EX

four CD
principal JJ

First JJ
, ,
there EX
were VBD
those DT
Congolese NNP
( (
among IN
them PRP
Joseph NNP

who WP
favored VBD
splitting VBG
the DT
country NN

Second JJ
, ,
there EX
were VBD
those DT
( (
Moise NNP

who WP
favored VBD
near-Balkanization NN
, ,
a DT

a DT
central JJ

with IN

Third JJ
, ,
there EX
were VBD
those DT
( (
notably RB
Patrice NNP

who WP
favored VBD
a DT
unified JJ
Congo NNP
with IN
a DT
very RB
strong JJ
central JJ
government NN

And CC
fourth JJ
, ,
there EX
were VBD
moderates NNS
who WP

in IN
no DT
hurry NN
for IN
independence NN
and CC
wished VBD
to TO
wait VB
until IN
the DT
Congo NNP
grew VBD
up IN
. .

However RB
, ,
the DT
positions NNS
of IN
all DT
parties NNS

leaders NNS
were VBD
constantly RB
shifting VBG

A DT
final JJ
factor NN
which WDT
contributed VBD
greatly RB
to TO
the DT
fragmentation NN
of IN
the DT
Congo NNP

immediately RB
after IN

, ,
was VBD
the DT
provincial JJ
structure NN
that WDT

They PRP

Katanga NNP

Equator NNP

Eastern NNP

unfortunately RB
with IN
little JJ
regard NN
for IN
ethnic JJ

Thus RB
some DT
provinces NNS
contained VBD
tribes NNS
which WDT
detested VBD
each DT
other JJ
, ,
and CC
to TO
them PRP
independence NN
meant VBD
an DT
opportunity NN
for IN

The DT
Belgian NNP
Congo NNP

granted VBN

independence NN
with IN
what WP

a DT
workable JJ
Western-style JJ
form NN

: :
there EX

a DT
bicameral JJ
legislature NN

in IN
the DT
provinces NNS

Well-wishers NNS

that IN
the DT
Congo NNP

quickly RB
assume VB
a DT
respectable JJ
position NN

If IN

the DT
25,000-man JJ
Congolese NNP

which WDT

The DT

seemed VBD
an DT

the DT

Patrice NNP
Lumumba NNP

a DT
reasonable JJ
man NN

Twenty-four JJ
hours NNS

the DT

Presently RB

Terror NN

however RB

a DT
co-operative JJ

under IN

whereby WRB

with IN

libraries NNS
share VBP
their PRP$

on IN

county-wide JJ

New NNP
York NNP
State NNP
has VBZ
what WP
is VBZ
probably RB
the DT
most RBS
advanced JJ
of IN
these DT
co-operative JJ
systems NNS
, ,
so RB
well RB
developed VBN
that IN
it PRP
has VBZ
become VBN
a DT
model NN
for IN
others NNS
to TO
follow VB

Because IN
it PRP
is VBZ
so RB
large JJ
a DT
state NN
, ,
with IN
marked JJ
contrasts NNS
in IN
population NN
density NN
, ,
the DT
organization NN
of IN
the DT
New NNP
York NNP
co-operative JJ
offers VBZ
a DT
cross-section NN
of IN
how WRB
the DT
plan NN
works NNS
. .

At IN
one CD
extreme NN
are VBP
the DT
systems NNS
of IN
upper JJ
New NNP
York NNP
State NNP
, ,
where WRB
libraries NNS
in IN
two CD
or CC
more JJR
counties NNS
combine VBP
to TO
serve VB
a DT
large JJ
, ,
sparsely RB
populated VBN
area NN
. .

At IN
the DT
other JJ
are VBP
organizations NNS
like IN
the DT
newly RB
formed VBN
Nassau NNP
Library NNP
System NNP
, ,
in IN
a DT
high-density JJ
area NN
, ,
with IN
ample JJ
resources NNS
and CC
a DT
rapidly RB
growing VBG
territory NN
to TO
serve VB
. .

Both PDT
these DT
types NNS
, ,
and CC
those DT
in IN
between IN
, ,
are VBP
in IN
existence NN
by IN
reason NN
of IN
a DT
legislative JJ
interest NN
in IN
libraries NNS
that WDT
began VBD
at IN
Albany NNP
as RB
early RB
as IN
1950 CD
, ,
with IN
the DT
creation NN
by IN
the DT
legislature NN
of IN
county NN
library NN
systems NNS
financed VBN
by IN
county NN
governments NNS
with IN
matching JJ
funds NNS
from IN
the DT
state NN
. .

It PRP
was VBD
a DT
step NN
in IN
the DT
right JJ
direction NN
, ,
but CC
it PRP
took VBD
an DT
additional JJ
act NN
passed VBN
in IN
1958 CD
to TO
establish VB
fully RB
the DT
thriving JJ
systems NNS
of IN
today RB
. .

Under IN
this DT
law NN
annual JJ
grants NNS
are VBP
given VBN
to TO
systems NNS
in IN
substantial JJ
amounts NNS
. .

An DT
earlier JJR
difficulty NN
was VBD
overcome VBN
by IN
making VBG
it PRP
clear JJ
that IN
individual JJ
libraries NNS
in IN
any DT
area NN
might MD
join VB
or CC
not RB
, ,
as IN
they PRP
saw VBD
fit NN
. .

Some DT
library NN
boards NNS
are VBP
wary JJ
of IN
the DT
plan NN
. .

A DT
large JJ
, ,
well-stocked JJ
library NN
, ,
surrounded VBN
in IN
a DT
county NN
by IN
smaller JJR
ones NNS
, ,
may MD
feel VB
that IN
the DT
demands NNS
on IN
its PRP$
resources NNS
are VBP
likely JJ
to TO
be VB
too RB
great JJ
. .

A DT
small JJ
library NN
may MD
cherish VB
its PRP$
independence NN
and CC
established VBN
ways NNS
, ,
and CC
resist VB
joining VBG
in IN
a DT
cooperative JJ
movement NN
that WDT
sometimes RB
seems VBZ
radical JJ
to TO
older JJR
members NNS
of IN
the DT
board NN
. .

Within IN
a DT
system NN
, ,
however RB
, ,
the DT
autonomy NN
of IN
each DT
member NN
library NN
is VBZ
preserved VBN
. .

The DT
local JJ
community NN
maintains VBZ
responsibility NN
for IN
the DT
financial JJ
support NN
of IN
its PRP$
own JJ
library NN
program NN
, ,
facilities NNS
, ,
and CC
services NNS
, ,
but CC
wider JJR
resources NNS
and CC
additional JJ
services NNS
become VBP
available JJ
through IN
membership NN
in IN
a DT
system NN
. .

All DT
services NNS
are VBP
given VBN
without IN
cost NN
to TO
members NNS

So RB
obvious JJ
are VBP
these DT
advantages NNS
that IN
nearly RB
95 CD
per IN

of IN
the DT
population NN
of IN
New NNP
York NNP
State NNP
now RB
has VBZ
access NN

enthusiastic JJ

too RB
distant JJ

when WRB
all PDT

To TO

Each DT

the DT
